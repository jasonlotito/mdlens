I want to build markdown reader/writer.

It should be written in electron.

It should open markdown files and read them. We should want to use GitHub style markdown files.

We should be able to edit them. When we edit them, we can open the markdown code on the left side of the print view on the right side.

We should be able to make the edit view the full page as well.

The markdown code should have full code coloring and editing support.

The UI should be clean. I'd prefer to stick to keyboard shortcuts for performing actions.

Shift + ? should open a help modal that provides details about how to use the app.

The apps name is mdlens (Markdown Lens).
